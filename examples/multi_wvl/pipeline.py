class MultiWavelengthPropagationPipeline:
    """
    Manages per-wavelength propagation through the lantern across a set
    of native wavelengths, WITHOUT holding every wavelength's heavy state
    (FEM mesh, mode-field trajectory, coupling-matrix trajectory) resident
    in memory at once.

    Usage
    -----
        mwp = MultiWavelengthPropagationPipeline(
            base_params=get_simulation_parameters(),
            ifunc=ifunc,
            native_wavelengths_nm=np.linspace(700, 900, 21),  # coarse solve grid
        )
        power, wl_out = mwp.get_power_spectra(
            coeff_matrix, output_wavelengths_nm=np.linspace(700, 900, 200)
        )  # power: (200, n_fields, n_fibers)

    Memory model
    ------------
    Each wavelength's ChainPropagator carries a mode-field trajectory
    (`vs`, shape roughly n_z_steps x n_modes x n_mesh_points, complex128)
    and a coupling-matrix trajectory (`cmats`, n_z_steps x n_modes x
    n_modes, complex128) for both the front and back segments. Depending
    on mesh size and adaptive step count these can individually reach the
    GB range. An earlier version of this class built and kept a
    BatchPropagationPipeline for every native wavelength in self.engines
    simultaneously -- fine for a handful of wavelengths, but it scales
    memory linearly with n_wavelengths and can OOM-kill the process
    (observed as a silent kernel crash, no Python traceback, after "a
    few" wavelengths loaded) for larger native grids.

    This version builds one wavelength's engine at a time inside
    propagate_batch(), extracts only the small result actually needed
    (uf_batch sliced to n_fibers complex numbers per field -- not the
    underlying GB-scale trajectory arrays), and explicitly drops the
    engine + forces garbage collection (Python and, best-effort, Julia --
    see _force_release_memory()) before moving to the next wavelength.
    Peak memory is therefore roughly O(1 wavelength) rather than
    O(n_wavelengths).

    Set cache_engines=True to opt back into keeping every engine resident
    (e.g. if you're propagating many different aberration batches against
    the same small native grid and want to avoid rebuilding each time) --
    only do this if you've confirmed your native grid is small enough,
    and your machine has enough RAM, to hold all of them at once.

    Notes on cost
    -------------
    Each native wavelength needs its own local-mode-basis characterization
    (see build_and_characterize_lantern_at_wavelength -- solved once and
    cached to disk; a fresh characterize() can take ~800 s (~13 min) on
    comparable z-extents, though loading a cached one is normally fast).
    Keep native_wavelengths_nm coarse (tens of points, denser near known
    mode-degeneracy/avoided-crossing regions -- see cbeam's compute_neffs()
    sanity check) and use output_wavelengths_nm for the finer grid you
    actually want in the dispersed spectra -- see
    interpolate_complex_spectra().

            comparable across fields and across wavelengths.

            generate_batch_modal_coefficients() renormalises every input
            field to unit L2 norm, which by itself discards how much of the
            focal-plane PSF actually coupled into the lantern (this varies
            strongly as an aberration walks the PSF off the multimode
            face, and with wavelength as the PSF breathes relative to
            rclad). We recover that here by multiplying each field's
            channel amplitudes by its coupling efficiency `eff` (the L2
            norm of the projected field *before* that renormalisation).
            `eff` is a consistent relative measure, not an absolute
            "fraction of incident power" -- use it for comparisons, not as
            an absolute transmission.

            Power is NOT taken here -- phase is preserved in case you want
            it (e.g. to sanity-check mode purity); take np.abs(...)**2 for
            detector-plane flux.
